The Unix file system has a hierarchical file like a tree with directories and files. There are a number of rudimentary commands you'll need to find your way around. For instance, to change directories, you'll need the cd command:

$ cd /bin

This command takes you to the directory that includes numerous binaries. Another useful command is ls, which is used to list the contents of a directory.

$ ls

Each user has a home directory that might look something like /Users/Matt. Unix has a special character for referencing the home directory: ~. For example, to change to the Documents directory in your home directory, it will look like this:

$ cd ~/Documents

Or, you can just go back to your home directory:

$ cd ~

Now, let's say we want to create a new directory. You'll need the mkdir command.

$ mkdir projects

This command will make a folder called "projects" in your current directory. To see your current directory, use pwd:

$ pwd

This will list the path of your current location.

Challenge: Use mkdir to create the "learn_linux" directory in your home directory.
