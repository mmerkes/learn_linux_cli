Oftentimes, you'll want to create an empty file. There's a command for that!

$ touch myfile.txt

When you run ls, you'll see that the file exists. You can also create a file within any directory.

$ touch ~/Documents/foo

This command would create an empty file called "foo" in the Documents directory in the home directory.

Challenge: Create an empty file called "empty.txt" inside the "learn_linux/challenges" directory you created in a previous challenge.
